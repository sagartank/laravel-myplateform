    We would like to thank you for trusting us as your factoring platform and also ask you for a small favor. We know
    how important user feedback is to improve our platform and make it even better.

    So, if you enjoyed your experience working with the seller and the paying company, we would appreciate it if you
    could take a few minutes to leave a review on our website. This will help other investors to make an informed
    decision and will also be useful for the seller and the paying company in future transactions.
