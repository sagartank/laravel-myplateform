    We want to remind you to keep an eye on your offers panel on to see if sellers have sent counter offers or if
    another investor has sent offers that are higher than yours. If you receive a counter offer or see that the seller
    has received a higher offer, you will have the opportunity to make an informed decision to maximize your profits.
